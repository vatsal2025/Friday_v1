# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

        comment: "The core AI trading engine implementation is working correctly. All API endpoints are functional and return the expected responses. The signal generation, portfolio metrics, and learning system APIs are working as expected. However, there's an issue with yfinance data retrieval for Indian stocks, which causes the system to fall back to default signals with minimal data. This is likely due to API limitations or network connectivity issues with Yahoo Finance."

        comment: "The OpenAI integration is properly implemented in the code. The API key is correctly configured in the .env file. However, due to issues with yfinance data retrieval, the OpenAI integration falls back to default messages as there's no market data to analyze. The integration code itself is correct and would work if market data was available."

        agent: "testing"
        comment: "The F&O symbols data pipeline is implemented correctly in the code, but there's an issue with yfinance data retrieval. The system is unable to fetch market data for Indian stocks, resulting in errors like 'Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)' and 'possibly delisted; no price data found'. This affects the signal generation and technical analysis calculations. The issue is likely due to API limitations, network connectivity, or changes in Yahoo Finance's API. The symbols grouping by sector works correctly."

The yfinance library is unable to fetch market data for Indian stocks, resulting in fallback to default signals. This affects the signal generation and OpenAI analysis.

Recommend investigating alternative data sources for Indian stocks or fixing the yfinance integration."
